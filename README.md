AdventOfCode 2017 Personal Solutions
====================================

My solutions in Python to the AdventOfCode 2017 site.  Input files are
unique to my own login for the site, so will not be useful to others;
they're just here to let me check them out wherever. ;)

WARNING: Using my code could be dangerous to your health. :P  Some of
the solutions may also be 'in progress', so may not work.  One should
also try solving these on one's own before using someone else's programs,
but that's just my own humble opinion. ;)
